The occipital lobe, to the posterior side. 
And in between the frontal and the occipital lobe is the parietal lobe, in the superior aspect of the hemisphere, and the temporal lobe, in the inferior aspect of the hemisphere.
The dividing line between the frontal lobe and the parietal lobe is the central sulcus. My index finger overlies the precentral gyrus, my middle finger the postcentral gyrus 
and the space between my fingers representing the central sulcus. So the central sulcus is the division between the frontal lobe and the parietal lobe. 
The division between the parietal lobe on the occipital lobe depends upon what we can see from the mid saggital plane, right about the, at the position of my finger is the parieto-occipital sulcus 
which marks one point of demarcation between the parietal lobe and the occipital lobe. The other is a feature of the inferior aspect of 
the hemisphere called the pre-occipital notch which is attributable to a flap of dura that sits between the cerebellum and the occipital lobe called the tentorium.
So an imaginary line between the parieto-occipital sulcus and that pre-occipital notch is what divides the, the parietal lobe from the occipital lobe and then the temporal 
lobe in front of the occipital lobe. 
So our temporal lobe then extends forward.
