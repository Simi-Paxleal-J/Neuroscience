** There are neuroglial cells, which are the subject of the next tutorial. **
And neuroglial cells, or just glia for short, perform a rich variety of
functions. And just to summarize those functions I
would say they support the electrical And the chemical function of neurons.
And then of course, the brain being a high, highly vascular structure requiring
a constant supply of blood and that blood comes nutrients, such as glucose, oxygen
and the ability to eliminate waste substances like carbon dioxide.
So with that rich supply of blood that we find throughout the central nervous system
we'll find vascular endothelium cells in brain tissue as well.
So let's focus now on a neuron, and I'll make a few general remarks first and then
we'll get on with our survey of the microanatomy of a typical neuron. **
