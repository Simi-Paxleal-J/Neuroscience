Learning Objectives
________________________________________
Let's get started in Medical Neuroscience!
Each lesson in Medical Neuroscience will begin with a page like this that provides you with an overview of the lesson, a bulleted list of learning objectives for the lesson's video tutorials, and a listing of the recommended readings from the course's textbook, Neuroscience, 6th Ed., by Purves et al., published by Oxford University Press (2018).
You should use the learning objectives as a means to guide your learning both prior to viewing a video tutorial and also when studying for the quizzes that you will take at the end of each lesson. These same learning objectives are also provided at the top of the notes files that accompany most video tutorials (except for the videos in this first lesson of this first module).
In this first lesson, "Getting to Know Prof. White and Medical Neuroscience", you will be introduced to Prof. White, the course itself, including the website "Learn Medical Neuroscience", and then briefly, Prof. White will suggest some tips for studying and learning.
Here are your learning objectives for this first set of videos: following completion of this lesson, you should be able to:
•	Tell a friend or family member about Prof. White's background in neuroscience.
•	Discuss the scope of Medical Neuroscience.
•	Visit the website LearnMedicalNeuroscience.nl and familiarize yourself with the Learning Community and Learning Resources pages found there.
•	Tell a friend or family member what Prof. White is asking of you in order to successfully complete Medical Neuroscience.
•	Reflect on your own learning preferences and consider how to apply Prof. White's 4 tips on "how to learn".
Teaching and learning is usually most productive if you know something about the professor's personal and professional background, so let's get started by learning about Prof. White's story, including his career in neuroscience.
